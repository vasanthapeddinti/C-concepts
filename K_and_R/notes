### Varibles and constants

# Variables
    1. Local variables (automatic variables): They are automatically deleted after the function is executed
    2. Global varibles: 

    3. extern variables: Variables that can be accessed by name by any function. Since external
    variables are globally accessible, they can be used instead of argument lists to communicate data between 
    functions. An external variable has to be defined, exactly once, outside of any function.
    The variable must be declared in each function that wants to access it.
