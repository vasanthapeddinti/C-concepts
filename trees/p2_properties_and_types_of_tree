Basic Trees:

1) The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^l.
2) The Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2^h – 1. (Assumption is 
that the height of root node is 1)
3) In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is? Log2(N+1) ? 
4) A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least | Log2L? |+ 1   levels   
5) In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.




Types of Trees:

1.Full Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children

2.Complete Binary Tree: A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely 
filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible 

3. Perfect Binary Tree: A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes 
have two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level. 

4. Balanced Binary Tree: A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n) where n is the number of nodes. 
For Example, the AVL tree maintains O(Log n) height by making sure that the difference between 
the heights of the left and right subtrees is atmost 1. 

5. A degenerate (or pathological) tree A Tree where every internal node has one child. Such trees
 are performance-wise same as linked list.
